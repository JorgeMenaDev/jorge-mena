Code review is where knowledge transfer, quality assurance, and team building intersect. Yet many teams treat it as a bureaucratic checkbox rather than an opportunity to elevate their craft.

## Why Code Review Matters

Code review isn't about finding bugs (though that's a benefit). It's about:

- **Knowledge sharing**: Spreading understanding across the team
- **Consistency**: Ensuring code meets team standards
- **Learning**: Finding better ways to solve problems
- **Culture**: Building a collaborative, learning-focused team

<Callout type="info">
  Research shows that thoughtful code review reduces bugs by 30%, improves code quality significantly, and creates a stronger team culture.

## The Reviewer's Mindset

### Be Kind, Be Clear, Be Helpful

```typescript
// ❌ Unhelpful review
"This is wrong. Use better variable names."

// ✅ Constructive review
"I found the variable names `x` and `temp` a bit unclear.
Consider something like `userIndex` and `previousValue` for clarity.
Here's why: [explanation]"
```

The best reviews explain the "why" behind suggestions, not just the "what."

### Focus on the Important Stuff

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't nitpick formatting and style—that's what linters are for. Focus on logic, security, performance, and maintainability.
</Callout>

Categorize feedback:

| Level | Example | Tone |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Critical** | Security vulnerabilities, logic errors | Blocking |
| **Important** | Performance issues, maintainability | Should fix |
| **Nice to have** | Alternative approaches, style suggestions | Suggestive |
| **Informational** | FYI, context, good catches | Supportive |

### Ask Questions

```typescript
// ❌ Accusatory
"Why did you write this? It's inefficient."

// ✅ Curious
"I'm curious about the choice here—did you consider using a Set
for O(1) lookups instead of an Array? What trade-offs did you weigh?"
```

Questions show respect for the author's decisions while prompting deeper thinking.

## The Author's Mindset

### Receive Feedback Gracefully

<Callout type="tip">
  Remember: criticism of your code isn't criticism of you. Your code is your work, not your identity.
</Callout>

When you receive feedback:

1. **Listen**: Understand the reviewer's perspective
2. **Ask clarifying questions**: Make sure you understand the concern
3. **Acknowledge**: Even if you disagree, acknowledge the thought
4. **Respond**: Explain your reasoning or fix the issue

### Ask for Help

```typescript
// Good practice: Ask for input on uncertain areas
// @reviewer: I'm not confident about this database query optimization.
// Thoughts on whether this change will cause performance issues?

const query = db.user
  .where({ active: true })
  .select({ id: true, name: true })
  .orderBy({ createdAt: "desc" })
```

## Best Practices for Code Reviews

### 1. Keep PRs Small

<Callout type="info">
  PRs over 400 lines of code take exponentially longer to review and are more likely to miss bugs. Aim for 150-300 lines.
</Callout>

### 2. Automate the Tedious Stuff

```bash
# Run these automatically, not in code review
npm run lint
npm run format
npm run test
npm run type-check
```

Focus your review on things humans are good at: logic, architecture, and maintainability.

### 3. Use Templates

```markdown
## What does this PR do?

[Brief description]

## How to test?

- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2

## Related issues

Fixes #123

## Type of change

- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
```

### 4. Set Expectations

- **SLA for review**: How long before expecting feedback?
- **Approval process**: Who needs to approve?
- **Merge responsibility**: Who merges (author or reviewer)?

## Red Flags in Code Review

Watch for these patterns:

```typescript
// ❌ Too much logic in one function
function processUserData(data) {
  // 50 lines of validation
  // 30 lines of transformation
  // 20 lines of formatting
  // 15 lines of API calls
}

// ✅ Broken into smaller functions
function validateUserData(data) { /* 10 lines */ }
function transformUserData(data) { /* 20 lines */ }
function formatUserData(data) { /* 15 lines */ }
function saveUserData(data) { /* 10 lines */ }
```

## Creating a Review Culture

### Lead by Example

- Provide thoughtful, kind, detailed reviews
- Ask questions instead of making statements
- Acknowledge good code
- Share learning moments

### Make it Safe

<Callout type="warning">
  If your team feels criticized during reviews, they'll stop participating. Foster a culture of psychological safety.
</Callout>

### Measure What Matters

Track:
- Average review turnaround time
- Team satisfaction with code review process
- Bug detection rate
- Time to merge

## Conclusion

Code review is a skill that improves with practice and intention. The best teams treat reviews not as gatekeeping, but as collaboration and growth.

Every review is an opportunity to:
- Make the codebase better
- Help a teammate grow
- Share knowledge across the team
- Build trust and respect

Invest in making code review great, and your entire team—and codebase—will benefit.
